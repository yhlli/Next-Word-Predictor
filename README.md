# Next-Word-Predictor
Final project for Ling131a

RUN MAIN.PY
 
PRETRAINED MODEL: keras_next_word_model.h5

Wordpredictor2.py is a separate word generator!

To run the wordpredictor2.py file, in the same folder you should have another folder called “saved_models” as well as either a path “data/grail.txt” if you wish to retrain the model yourself, or edit the code to reflect the data you wish to train on. Additionally, if you do not wish to retrain the whole model yourself, you should make sure to locate the model hardcoded into the file and have that at hand to use as the model.
